# JSONHelper
Flask app to help students understand how to manipulate JSON objects

URL: https://jsonhelpersinthushan.herokuapp.com/

## How it works:

User inputs link to a JSON file (ex: http://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/all/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?format=json) and is returned with a formated output where end nodes can be 
clicked and the user will recieve Python code that can be used to reach that node via code.

Requirements:

*Flask

*Requests

*JSON
